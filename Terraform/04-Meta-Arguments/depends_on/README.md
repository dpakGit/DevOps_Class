#### Q) Describe the various use cases of terraform depends_on ?

Sol:  Here are some common use cases for Terraform's depends_on attribute:

1. Resource dependencies: When a resource depends on another resource being created or updated first, use depends_on to establish the dependency.
2. Avoiding resource deletion: When deleting a resource, Terraform might try to delete dependent resources first. Use depends_on to prevent this and ensure resources are deleted in the correct order.
3. Handling resource timing issues: In some cases, Terraform might create resources too quickly, causing issues. depends_on can help ensure resources are created in the correct order.
4. External resource dependencies: When Terraform resources depend on external resources (e.g., manually created resources), use depends_on to establish the dependency.
5. Module dependencies: In Terraform modules, depends_on can ensure resources within the module are created in the correct order.
6. Avoiding circular dependencies: Terraform can detect circular dependencies and prevent them. depends_on can help avoid these issues by explicitly defining dependencies.
7. Resource creation ordering: Use depends_on to control the order in which resources are created, especially when there are complex dependencies.
8. Inter-module dependencies: When multiple Terraform modules are used, depends_on can establish dependencies between resources across modules.

By using depends_on, you can better manage resource creation and dependencies, ensuring your Terraform configurations are predictable and reliable. 

#### Q) Explain each one of the above use case with examples ?

Sol: Here are detailed explanations of each use case with examples:

1. Resource Dependencies

When a resource depends on another resource being created or updated first, use depends_on to establish the dependency.

Example:


hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "web_server_sg" {
  name        = "web_server_sg"
  description = "Security group for web server"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  depends_on = [aws_instance.web_server]
}


In this example, the aws_security_group resource depends on the aws_instance resource being created first.

2. Avoiding Resource Deletion

When deleting a resource, Terraform might try to delete dependent resources first. Use depends_on to prevent this and ensure resources are deleted in the correct order.

Example:


hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_volume_attachment" "web_server_volume" {
  device_name  = "/dev/sdh"
  instance_id  = (link unavailable)
  volume_id     = (link unavailable)
  skip_destroy  = true

  depends_on = [aws_instance.web_server]
}


In this example, the aws_volume_attachment resource depends on the aws_instance resource. When deleting the aws_instance resource, Terraform will not delete the aws_volume_attachment resource first.

3. Handling Resource Timing Issues

In some cases, Terraform might create resources too quickly, causing issues. depends_on can help ensure resources are created in the correct order.

Example:


hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "web_server_dns" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.example.zone_id
  name    = "(link unavailable)"
  type    = "A"
  alias {
    name                   = aws_lb.example.dns_name
    zone_id                = aws_lb.example.zone_id
    evaluate_target_health = true
  }

  depends_on = [aws_instance.web_server]
}


In this example, the aws_route53_record resource depends on the aws_instance resource being created first.

4. External Resource Dependencies

When Terraform resources depend on external resources (e.g., manually created resources), use depends_on to establish the dependency.

Example:


hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "web_server_sg" {
  name        = "web_server_sg"
  description = "Security group for web server"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  depends_on = [aws_security_group.manual_sg]
}

resource "aws_security_group" "manual_sg" {
  // This resource is created manually outside of Terraform
  // ...
}


In this example, the aws_security_group resource depends on an external aws_security_group resource created manually.

5. Module Dependencies

In Terraform modules, depends_on can ensure resources within the module are created in the correct order.

Example:


hcl
// File: modules/web_server/main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "web_server_sg" {
  name        = "web_server_sg"
  description = "Security group for web server"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  depends_on = [aws_instance.web_server]
}


In this example, within the web_server module, the aws_security_group resource depends on the aws_instance resource being created first.

6. Avoiding Circular Dependencies

Terraform can detect circular dependencies and prevent them. depends_on can help avoid these issues by explicitly defining dependencies.

Example:


hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_security_group"

#### Q)  can there be more elaborate examples with explanations ?\

Sol: 

Here are some more elaborate examples with explanations:

Example 1: Resource Dependencies

Suppose we have a web server that depends on a security group and an Elastic IP.


hcl
# Create a security group
resource "aws_security_group" "web_server_sg" {
  name        = "web_server_sg"
  description = "Security group for web server"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Create an Elastic IP
resource "aws_eip" "web_server_eip" {
  vpc = true
}

# Create a web server that depends on the security group and Elastic IP
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [(link unavailable)]
  depends_on = [aws_security_group.web_server_sg, aws_eip.web_server_eip]
}


In this example, the aws_instance resource depends on the aws_security_group and aws_eip resources. Terraform will create the security group and Elastic IP before creating the web server.

Example 2: Avoiding Resource Deletion

Suppose we have a database instance that depends on a security group.


hcl
# Create a security group
resource "aws_security_group" "db_sg" {
  name        = "db_sg"
  description = "Security group for database"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 5432
    to_port     = 5432
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Create a database instance that depends on the security group
resource "aws_db_instance" "database" {
  allocated_storage    = 20
  engine                = "postgres"
  engine_version        = "12.5"
  instance_class        = "db.t2.micro"
  name                   = "mydatabase"
  username               = "myuser"
  password               = "mypassword"
  vpc_security_group_ids = [(link unavailable)]
  skip_final_snapshot    = true
  depends_on              = [aws_security_group.db_sg]
}


In this example, the aws_db_instance resource depends on the aws_security_group resource. When deleting the aws_db_instance resource, Terraform will not delete the aws_security_group resource first.

Example 3: Handling Resource Timing Issues

Suppose we have a load balancer that depends on a target group.


hcl
# Create a target group
resource "aws_lb_target_group" "example" {
  name     = "example"
  port     = 80
  protocol = "HTTP"
  vpc_id   = "vpc-12345678"
}

# Create a load balancer that depends on the target group
resource "aws_lb" "example" {
  name               = "example"
  internal           = false
  load_balancer_type = "application"
  security_groups    = [(link unavailable)]
  subnets            = [(link unavailable), (link unavailable)]

  depends_on = [aws_lb_target_group.example]
}


In this example, the aws_lb resource depends on the aws_lb_target_group resource. Terraform will create the target group before creating the load balancer.

Example 4: External Resource Dependencies

Suppose we have a security group that depends on an external security group created manually.


hcl
# Create a security group that depends on an external security group
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name        = "example"
  description = "Security group example"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  depends_on = [aws_security_group.manual_sg]
}

# External security group created manually
resource "aws_security_group" "manual_sg" {
  // This resource is created manually outside of Terraform
  // ...
}


In this example, the aws_security_group resource depends on an external aws_security_group resource created manually.

Example 5: Module Dependencies

Suppose we have a module that creates a web server and a security group.


hcl
# File: modules/web_server/main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-abc123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "web_server_sg" {
  name        = "web_server_sg"
