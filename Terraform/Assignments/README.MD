Here is a rewritten version of the text in a more formal and objective-oriented tone:

Task Objectives:

1. Infrastructure Deployment

Deploy 8 instances across two different regions, with 4 instances in each region.

2. Instance Configuration

Ensure each availability zone has one backend instance and one frontend instance.

3. Zero-Downtime Deployment

Implement a zero-downtime deployment strategy for frontend instances. When updating, ensure the new frontend instance is fully operational before replacing the older instance.

4. Backend Server Management

Maintain the existing backend servers without deletion or modification.

5. Output Requirements

Provide the public IP addresses of frontend and backend instances in Region 1 as output.
```

```
